## Computer Vision Course 

taught by Prof. Sudeep Sarkar, University of South Florida, Tampa, USA

A series of Colab (Jupyter) notebooks that walk you through the fundamentals of Computer Vision in python/opencv/pytorch/numpy/scipy. 

This is a graduate elective course in the general theme of artificial intelligence (AI) and will teach you about algorithms to extract information from images and video. We will learn about the problems of segmentation, tracking, extraction of geometric transforms in images, estimation of 3D information from a 2D image(s), and object detection and recognition using traditional and deep learning methods. 

### Course Structure 

The course is divided into 9 modules. Each module covers a topic area divided into class sessions. Two class sessions constitute a week. Each module typically spans one to two weeks. Each class session include reading materials and assignments will involve running some variation of a code or solving some math problem, or providing explanations.

### Course Objectives

- Solve the core problems in computer vision, including segmentation, low-level features, tracking, 2D and 3D image geometry, structure from motion, stereo, and object recognition.

- Use traditional approaches and new deep learning-based solutions to solve computer vision problems.

- Apply the theoretical pinning of the major solution approaches

- Write computer vision code based on this understanding to solve real-life problems.
